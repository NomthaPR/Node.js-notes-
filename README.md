Learning about Node.js

Node.js doesn't stand for any specific words or phrases. The name "Node.js" was chosen because it evokes the idea of nodes in a network or a graph, 
which reflects its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. The "js" part refers to JavaScript, the primary programming language used in Node.js development.
Node.js is not a programming laungeage but its  more like an application to use when you want to run Javascript. its actually created to execute javascript code outside the broweser, be able to open it, read and run it. 
Node managies the server and increases Javascript capabilities, eliminating time. Node.js is a runtime environment that excutes Javascript.
